# ðŸ§® Calculator PWA 

Small sample project inside which I very quickly programmed a calculator to try to create a progressive web app

To create this example I used [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/), `typescript` in a [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) project using [`vite-pwa`](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) plugin to convert my project to an application 

If you want you can try this example at this link [calculator.teobale.dev](https://calculator.teobale.dev)
